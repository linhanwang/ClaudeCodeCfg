# RTK - Rust Token Killer

**Usage**: Token-optimized CLI proxy (60-90% savings on dev operations)

## Meta Commands (always use rtk directly)

```bash
rtk gain              # Show token savings analytics
rtk gain --history    # Show command usage history with savings
rtk discover          # Analyze Claude Code history for missed opportunities
rtk proxy <cmd>       # Execute raw command without filtering (for debugging)
```

## Installation Verification

```bash
rtk --version         # Should show: rtk X.Y.Z
rtk gain              # Should work (not "command not found")
which rtk             # Verify correct binary
```

⚠️ **Name collision**: If `rtk gain` fails, you may have reachingforthejack/rtk (Rust Type Kit) installed instead.

## Usage

There is no auto-rewrite hook; commands run exactly as written. Invoke `rtk`
explicitly, and only for bulky read-only output where a filtered view is fine
(e.g. `rtk git log`, `rtk ls`, `rtk grep`). Never use rtk when stdout is
redirected to a file or parsed, or when exact verbatim output matters.

Refer to CLAUDE.md for full command reference.
